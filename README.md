## Installation ##
Download the file as *.zip* from ***Github*** and extract the File. <br>open `Fusion-Main` and move the file `de.sylvertax.teamspeak` to: `%AppData%/TeamSpeak/Default/extensions` <br>

Open the Teamspeak 5 Client   <br>
Go to `Settings > Appearance ` <br>
Select fusion and choose your theme of choice.

## Customize ##
To create your own theme you only need a color palette so that you can use your color codes properly, I recommend this [Color Palette](https://colorkit.co/color-palette-generator/2f7de4-2a6abe-1c2437-2b3346-242c3f-d6d6d6/). <br>
Is already the color palette for the custom theme available.

Use your text editor of choice and edit the color codes given in the file. <br>
Right click on file `customize.css` and open with `Text Editor`. <br>
Change the colors of your choice and save the file. <br>
now restart Teamspeak or open it and select the theme `Custom`. ***Done!***

If you edit the files while you have Teamspeak open, there is also the function to reload your theme with a button press and directly see the change, so you also have in mind what changes. do you have any questions then look below at contacts, I'm only a few steps away for help if something does not work.
